# playground-kafka
Small tests for Kafka 2.1 consumer api and streaming api, 
showing how to send, pull and stream messages using Java 8.

Kafka 0.11 has some nice new features like exactly-once semantics
and atomic writes using the new transaction API.  Read more about
these feature in this excellent article 
[Exactly-once Semantics are Possible: Hereâ€™s How Kafka Does it](https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/).

## Prerequisite 
In order to run these small examples you need a running Kafka broker on 
localhost port 9092 with a topic called ```test-topic```.

## Quickstart Kafka broker
Start a Kafka broker locally by using [Blacktop Kafka Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/blacktop/kafka/).

```
docker run -d \
           --name kafka \
           -p 9092:9092 \
           -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=localhost \
           -e KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS="test-topic:1:1" \
           blacktop/kafka
```

More info about Kafka can be found in the [Kafka Documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)

When the Docker container has started you can start and stop as needed. 

```
docker stop kafka
docker start kafka

docker ps -a (lists all docker containers, even those not running)
```

## Running the demos
There are two consumer examples, they connect to the broker using different group.id / application.id
so they will both receive all messages and they can be run in parallel.

- [ ] AdminClientTest, connects to broker and list topics and cluster info
- [ ] TestProducer, connects to broker and send x messages of y size
- [ ] PollConsumer, connects to broker and pulls messages
- [ ] StreamConsumer, connects to broker and streams messages
